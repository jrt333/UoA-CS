# CS373-2025-Image-Processing-Assignment
In this assignment, you will write a Python code pipeline to automatically detect all the road signs in the given images. This is an individual assignment, so every student has to submit this assignment! This assignment is worth 15 marks.

We have provided you with some road sign images for testing your pipeline (you can find the images in the `Images/easy` folder).
- Your pipeline should be able to detect all the signs in the image labelled with easy-level (5 images).
- For extension, try images labelled as hard-level images in the `Images/hard` folder.
- Write a short reflective report about your extension. (Using Latex/Word)

Note: The main component of the assignment (“CS373_sign_detection.py”) must not use any non-built-in Python packages (e.g., PIL, OpenCV, NumPy, etc.) except for Matplotlib. Ensure your IDE hasn't added any of these packages to your imports. To install `Matplotlib` Python package, go to your Windows command prompt, and type the following command: `pip install -U matplotlib`.

To run automatic assignment testing locally on your machine, you need to install `Pytest` Python package by typing `pip install -U Pytest` in your Windows command prompt.

The online GitHub automatic assignment testing and marking uses Windows and Python version 3.11.9, please test your pipeline on Windows platform with correct Python version envioronment.
